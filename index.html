            <div class="point">
            <ul>
                <li><h2>Prevent Allergy Flare-Ups and Risks</h2><br><p>Many people have severe allergies to certain insects. Their lives would be at risk if these animals were not controlled.

                    Bees and wasps, for instance, are the insects that cause the most severe allergies, despite the fact that bees are very useful for the environment. Other problematic insects are mosquitoes and bed bugs, which can cause skin rashes in some people.
                    
                    Cockroaches are also a common allergen, as at least 7% of the population is allergic to them. Moreover, cockroaches can also increase the severity of asthma, especially in children.</p></li>
                    <br>

                    <li><h2>Prevent the Spread of Diseases</h2><br><p>Mosquitoes can carry many diseases, some of them deadly, such as dengue fever, malaria, West Nile virus, arboviral encephalitis, and yellow fever. Mosquitoes are also dangerous for pets since they can spread deadly heartworm larvae. Just think that 90% of all cases of malaria occur in countries where pest control is not practiced.

                        Typhus is another dangerous disease, carried by fleas and lice.
                        
                        Many of these diseases nowadays are treatable, but they can cause serious problems for the most vulnerable individuals, such as older people, children, and people with compromised immune systems.</p></li>
                        <br>
                        <li><h2>Prevent More Damage to Homes and Structures</h2><br><p>Termites are a problem in many homes. If not controlled, they can consume wood, paper, and plywood.

                            In the long run, termites can deteriorate floorings, walls, and beams, causing serious damages that will put the stability of your house at risk.
                            
                            Many times, you will notice something’s wrong when it’s already too late. Just think that in the USA, $5 billion on average are spent on termite damages.
                            
                            Oftentimes, with termites, it’s necessary to call a pest control agency to completely stop termites.</p></li>
                            <br>
                            <li><h2>Prevent More Damage to Furniture, Carpets, and Clothes</h2><br><p>Many pests can cause costly damage not only to house structures, but also to carpets, clothing, and furniture.

                                Some insects can feed from fabrics and if not controlled will completely ruin your furnishings. These include carpet bugs, moths, cockroaches, and silverfish.
                                
                                Other than being a nuisance, this is also a big economic issue for many families.</p></li>
                                <br>
                                <li><h2>Prevent More Pest Nests In the House</h2><br><p>Some pests can get established in houses before people realize they are even there. They will reproduce until their population gets too big not to be noticed. Sometimes, this can take just a few days, if not hours.</p></li>
                                <br>
                                <li><h2>Prevent Decrease of Food Supply</h2><br><p>Weeds, insects, and fungi all pose threats to crops, causing big production losses. This would in turn mean increased prices and more hunger.

                                    Pest control is also vital during the conservation phase, as rodents for example consume up to 20% of the world’s food supply.
                                    
                                    Another problem with these animals is that they also pose a health risk as well as an economic one since they leave excrements behind that contaminate food.</p></li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li><h2>Prevent Uneatable, Toxic Food</h2><br><p>Pests that feed on our fruits and vegetables can leave wounds that are a perfect way for bacteria to infest food and reproduce.

                                        Many of these microbes will be left on the food supply to grow and release toxins that make the products dangerous for humans.
                                        
                                        Fungicides and bactericides can reduce toxin levels and make food healthier to eat.</p></li>
